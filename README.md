# Lineup - Photo Duplicate Manager

A cross-platform, intuitive, python-based desktop application with GUI for identifying and handling duplicate or similar images based on output from preprocessing a directory using [photochomper](https://github.com/johnzastrow/photochomper).

(Note: This is not a duplicate finder - it requires pre-generated CSV data from photochomper or similar tool.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+ (recommended)
- customtkinter >= 5.2.0
- pillow >= 10.0.0  
- pandas >= 2.0.0
- pillow-heif >= 0.10.0 (for HEIC/HEIF support)
- uv (for dependency management, optional but recommended)
- (Optional) photochomper for generating CSV files
-  Windows, macOS, or Linux OS
  
  
## Installation and Quick Start

This app was built and tested using Python 3.13 and using the `uv` tool from Astral for dependency management.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd lineup
```

**2. Install dependencies using uv:**
```bash
uv sync
```

**3. Launch the application:**
```bash
uv run main.py
```
**Once in the UI, follow these steps:**

1. **Load your data**: Click "Load CSV File" and select your photo groupings file
   - Use "Reload" button to refresh data from the same CSV file

2. **Configure settings** (optional):
   - Toggle "Auto-select Duplicates" to automatically select non-master images
   - Toggle "Hide Single Groups" to focus on groups with multiple images
   - Toggle "Dark Mode" for your preferred theme

3. **Set up "Move to" directory** (optional): Click "Browse..." next to "Move To:" to pre-select a destination folder

4. **Navigate groups**: Click on any group in the left panel - selected groups show in blue
   - Use "Previous Group" and "Next Group" buttons or P/N keys for navigation

5. **Review images**: 
   - Thumbnails automatically size to use available screen space
   - Master images show with ‚òÖ MASTER 
   - Missing files display with ‚ùå indicators
   - Auto-selection highlights duplicates for quick processing

6. **Select and manage duplicates**:
   - Single-click images to select/deselect (red/orange borders)
   - Use "Delete Selected (D)" or "Move Selected (M)" buttons
   - Status messages show operation results with auto-clear

7. **Use the image viewer**:
   - Double-click any thumbnail for full-size viewing
   - Navigate with arrow keys or Previous/Next buttons
   - Jump between groups without closing the viewer
   - Delete or move images directly from the viewer

## üéØ Pro Tips

- **Efficient workflow**: Enable "Auto-select Duplicates" and set a "Move To" directory for rapid processing
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: 
  - Image viewer: ‚Üê/‚Üí for navigation, Esc to close
  - Main app: D=Delete, M=Move, P=Previous Group, N=Next Group
- **Smart processing**: The app auto-advances to the next group after operations for continuous workflow
- **Visual indicators**: 
  - Green borders = unselected images
  - Red/orange borders = selected images  
  - Blue group buttons = currently selected
  - ‚òÖ MASTER text = recommended keeper images
  - ‚ùå indicators = missing files
- **Reload functionality**: Use the "Reload" button to refresh data after external changes to files
- **Filter controls**: Hide single-image groups to focus on actual duplicates
- **Check logs**: View detailed activity in `logs/lineup_info.log` and debug info in `logs/lineup_debug.log`

## CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain these columns and you can generate it using the `--search` function in [photochomper](https://github.com/johnzastrow/photochomper) or create it manually:
- `GroupID`: Identifier grouping similar photos together
- `Master`: Boolean indicating the recommended image to keep
- `File`: Image filename
- `Path`: Full path to the image file
- `MatchReasons`: Description of why images are considered duplicates

Example CSV structure:
```csv
GroupID,Master,File,Path,MatchReasons
1,True,IMG_001.jpg,/path/to/IMG_001.jpg,Exact duplicate
1,False,IMG_001_copy.jpg,/path/to/IMG_001_copy.jpg,Visually similar, Same size, Same Date
```

A sample CSV file (`sample_data.csv`) is included for testing.



## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### **Architecture**

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **`main.py`**: Main application with enhanced UI, logging, and global state management
- **`data_manager.py`**: CSV processing, validation, and group management
- **`image_manager.py`**: Image loading, caching, thumbnails, and full-size viewer

### **Technology Stack**

- **GUI Framework**: customtkinter (modern, themeable UI components)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (thumbnail generation, format support)
- **Data Handling**: pandas (CSV parsing, data manipulation)
- **Caching**: File-based thumbnail cache with metadata
- **Logging**: Multi-level structured logging system

### **Key Features Implementation**

- **Dynamic Layout**: Responsive grid system with optimal thumbnail sizing
- **State Management**: Global directory sharing between main app and image viewer
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time UI updates with color-coded status indicators
- **Performance**: Asynchronous thumbnail loading with progress callbacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly messages
