# Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a cross-platform desktop application that allows users to manage and organize their photo collections by identifying and handling duplicate or similar images based on data provided in a CSV file.

# Requirements
1. The application must be cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.
2. The application must read and parse a CSV file containing the following fields: `GroupID`, `Master`, `File`, `Path`, `MatchReasons`.
3. The application must display images grouped by `GroupID`.
4. The application must highlight the `Master` image in each group as the recommended image to keep.
5. Users must be able to select one or more images within a group.
- Users must be able to perform actions on selected images, specifically:
- Delete selected images.
- Move selected images to a specified directory.
- The application must provide a user-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation and operation.
- The application must handle errors gracefully, such as missing files or inaccessible paths.
- The application must provide feedback to users on the success or failure of their actions (e.g
- , confirmation dialogs, success messages).
- The application must allow users to load a new CSV file without restarting the application.
- The application must be responsive and perform well with large collections of images.
- The application must include a help section or user guide to assist users in understanding how to use the features.
- The application must be developed using open-source technologies and libraries where possible.
- The application must be tested on all supported platforms to ensure consistent functionality and performance.
- The application must include logging capabilities to track user actions and any errors encountered during operation.
- The application must be maintainable and allow for future enhancements or feature additions.
- The application must be documented, including installation instructions, user guides, and developer documentation for future maintenance.
- The application must support localization for multiple languages, allowing users to select their preferred language for the interface.
- The application must provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions to enhance user efficiency.
- The window must be resizable, and the layout should adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- The image viewer should support zooming and panning for better image inspection.
- The image thumbnails should be generated for faster loading and display.
- image thumbnails should be cached to improve performance on subsequent loads.
- The application should allow users to filter and sort images within a group based on criteria such as file size, date modified, or match reasons.
- The application should provide an option to preview images in full size before performing actions.
- The application should allow users to undo the last action (delete or move) in case of mistakes.
- The application should provide an option to export a report of the actions taken (e.g., list of deleted or moved files).
- images should be displayed to take advantage of available screen space, with an adaptive grid or list layout.
- The application should provide a dark mode option for better usability in low-light environments.
- The application should include a search functionality to quickly locate specific images within the loaded groups.
- Highlight the Master image in each group with a distinct border or icon to differentiate it from other images.
- The application should allow users to select multiple images using standard selection methods (e.g., Ctrl+Click, Shift+Click).
- Users should see all the images in the same group and be able to move or delete any of them.
- 16. The application should include logging capabilities to track user actions and any errors encountered during operation.

# Source Data
1. Read the fields `GroupID`, `Master`, `File`, `Path`, `MatchReasons` in a selected .csv file to present a cross-platform (windows,linux, macos) GUI to desktop users to allow them to view a collection of photos and select one or more to perform actions on. 
2. The CSV contains a list of similar photos, with similar images having the same GroupID. Users will use the groupings to select one or more images to delete or move to remove duplicate or very similar images. The recommended image to keep is the Master image. 
3. Optionally display the other fields in the CSV file
4. The CSV file may contain paths to images that are missing or inaccessible. The application should handle these cases gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

# Approach
1. View mockup.png as an example interface and ask me questions.
2. Then propose appropriate technologies
3. Then propose an implementation plan.
4. Then implement the plan step by step, asking for my feedback and approval at each step.
5. The final deliverable is the complete source code in a public github repo, with a README.md file with installation and usage instructions, and a sample CSV file to demonstrate functionality.
6. The code should be well structured, commented, and follow best practices for the chosen technologies.
7. The application should be tested on all three platforms to ensure consistent functionality and performance.
8. The application should be easy to install and run, with clear instructions provided in the README.md file.
9. The application should be user-friendly, with an attractive, modern, intuitive interface and clear instructions for use.
10. The application should be robust, handling errors gracefully and providing useful feedback to the user.
11. The application should be maintainable, with clear and well-documented code that follows best practices for the chosen technologies.
12. The application should be extensible, allowing for future enhancements or feature additions.
13. The application should be open-source, with the source code available in a public github repo.
14. The application should be tested on all supported platforms to ensure consistent functionality and performance.
15. The application should be documented, including installation instructions, user guides, and developer documentation for future maintenance.
