Read the fields `GroupID`, `Master`, `File`, `Path`, `MatchReasons` in a selected .csv file to present a cross-platform (windows,linux, macos) GUI to desktop users to allow them to view a collection of photos and select one or more to perform actions on. 

The CSV contains a list of similar photos, with similar images having the same GroupID. Users will use the groupings to select one or more images to delete or move to remove duplicate or very similar images. The recommended image to keep is the Master image. 

Users should see all the images in the same group and be able to move or delete any of them.

View mockup.png as an example interface and ask me questions.

Then propose appropriate technologies and an implementation plan.
