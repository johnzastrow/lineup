# Lineup Usage Guide

This guide covers all the features and workflows in Lineup for efficient photo duplicate management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Basic Workflow
1. **Launch**: Run `uv run main.py`
2. **Load Data**: Click "Load CSV File" to import your photo groups
3. **Set Move Directory**: (Optional) Click "Browse..." to pre-select destination

## üìÅ Data Requirements

### CSV File Format
Your CSV must contain these exact column headers:
- `GroupID` - Groups similar photos together (any string/number)
- `Master` - `True` for recommended keeper, `False` for duplicates  
- `File` - Image filename (e.g., "IMG_001.jpg")
- `Path` - Full file path (e.g., "/Users/name/Photos/IMG_001.jpg")
- `MatchReasons` - Why images are similar (e.g., "Exact duplicate")

### Sample CSV
```csv
GroupID,Master,File,Path,MatchReasons
1,True,IMG_001.jpg,/path/to/IMG_001.jpg,Exact duplicate
1,False,IMG_001_copy.jpg,/path/to/IMG_001_copy.jpg,Exact duplicate
2,True,vacation.jpg,/path/to/vacation.jpg,Near duplicate
2,False,vacation_edit.jpg,/path/to/vacation_edit.jpg,95% similarity
